# Easy Metro
Harvey Dent the mayor of Mars city has thrown open the newly built metro lines to the public. The metro connects all prominent places in the city. The metro consists of 5 lanes each indicated by the color as shown in the below map.

The stations are placed exactly 5 minutes away from each other. Ticket cost are calculated as 1$ for every station to destination (inclusive) and 1$ at stations where they switch line.

People find it difficult to find the fastest way to reach the destination and the cost of tickets that they need to buy.

Design a mobile application that can help the tech savvy people of the Mars city so that they reach the destination in the minimal possible time and also display the cost.
